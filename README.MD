This is my very first portfolio page written in Vanilla JavaScript after 3 month of coding.
My basic goal was to display the data of my CV in a tasteful manner and also provide a simple swiper to show my portoflio.

Next on my ToDoList regarding this project:
- Recreate the full website using React.

# Technologies used:
JavaScript / Sass / HTML 
swiper = http://swiperjs.com
- Written in VsCode -
