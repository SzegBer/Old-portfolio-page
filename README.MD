# portfolio

![screenshot01](https://github.com/SzegBer/Portfolio-page/blob/master/hello.png?raw=true)

This is my very first portfolio page written in Vanilla JavaScript using CSS formatting only - after 3 month of coding.
My basic goal was to display the data of my CV in a tasteful manner and also provide a simple swiper to show my portoflio.

## Next on my ToDoList regarding this project:
- Recreate the full website using React
> wich is finished :) check it out: https://portfolio-4cf76.firebaseapp.com/

## Technologies used:
- JavaScript / Sass / HTML 
- swiper = http://swiperjs.com
- Written in VsCode
